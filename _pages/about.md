You may find something interesting (nothing to do with academy) at [Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/66081758), where I upload some videos to vlog my life. Besides, I desire for my own band and might be responsible for vocal part, pursuing a sub-world in music. If you would like to go body combat or spanning, I’m surely to join.
